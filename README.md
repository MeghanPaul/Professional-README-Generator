# Professional README Generator
This Node application uses terminal input given by the user to create a professional README file. The file includes a clickable table of contents and a license badge, as well as sections covering installation, usage, contributing, licensing, testing, and questions. Not all sections will be included, based on what information the user gives. The resulting file will be put in the generatedProduct folder.
